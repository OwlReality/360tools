# 360tools 

	Projection and quality evaluation tools for VR video compression exploration experiments

## Description
	+ 360tools_conv is used for conversion between different projection formats
	+ 360tools_metric implements various quality metrics for vR video quality evaluation
	
	The 360tools is software for VR video processing experiments.
	The software includes both 360 video conversion and quality metrics
	functionality
	
	360tools software is useful in aiding users of a 360 VR video coding
	experiments to establish and test various processing techniques for VR video
	content.
	360tools is useful to educate users. For these purposes, the software is
	provided as an aid for the study and implementation of 360 VR video coding and
	may eventually be formally published as reference software, e.g., by
	ITU-T and ISO/IEC.
	
	This software may be subject to other third party and contributor rights,
	including patent rights and no such rights are granted.

	./360tools_conv -i glacier_vr_24p_3840x1920.yuv -w 3840 -h 1920 -x 1 -o glacier_vr_24p_isp_4268x2016.yuv -l 4268 -m 2016 -y 1 -f 5 -n 10
	
## Example usage for quality metrics

	./360tools_metrics -w [int] -h [int] -f [int] -o [file] -q [int] -l [int] -m [int] -t [int] -r [file] -n [int] -x [int]
	./360tools_metrics -w 4096 -h 2048 -f 1 -o glacier_vr_24p_3840x1920.yuv -q 4 -l 4268 -m 2016 -t 2 -r glacier_vr_24p_isp_4268x2016.yuv -n 7 -x 1 
	
## Supported formats
	+	Equirectangular projection (ERP)
	+	Icosahedral projection (ISP)
	+	Octahedron projection (OHP)
	+	Cubemap projection (CMP)
	+	Truncated Square Pyramid projection (TSP)
	+	Segmented Sphere projection (SSP)
	+	Reshaped Icosahedral projection (RISP)
	+	Reshaped Octahedron projection (ROHP)
	+	Reshaped Cubemap projection (RCMP)
	
## Supported quality metrics
	+	PSNR - conventional Peak Signal to Noise Ratio quality metrics
	+	S-PSNR - spherical PSNR (requires sphere_655362.txt file with point coordinates)
	+	WS-PSNR - weighted Spherical PSNR (for equirectangular projection only)
	+	CPP-PSNR - equal area common projection PSNR
